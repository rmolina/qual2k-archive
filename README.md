# qual2k-archive

This repository is an archive of the [QUAL2K](https://www.qual2k.com/download.html) model versions.

I got v1.0 (2003), v2.07 (2007), and 2.11b8 (2009) from Internet Archive's [snapshots](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.epa.gov/athens/wwqtsc/html/qual2k.html), and the most recent versions from the QUAL2K website.

There was also a v2.04 from 2006, but I still need to find a copy.
